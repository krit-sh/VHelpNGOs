# VHelpNGOs

Welcome to **VHelpNGOs**! This project aims to connect volunteers with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide essential support for meaningful causes. This website serves as a platform for NGOs to post volunteer opportunities, while volunteers can easily explore, apply for, and engage with projects that align with their interests and skills.

## Features

- **Explore NGOs**: Browse a curated list of NGOs looking for volunteers across various domains.
- **Opportunity Listings**: Each NGO can list current opportunities with details, so volunteers know where they can help.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on different devices to ensure volunteers and NGOs can engage on the go.
- **Easy Navigation**: Simple, clean interface with clear navigation to make browsing opportunities seamless.

## Technologies Used
